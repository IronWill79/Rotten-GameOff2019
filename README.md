### Rotten
#### A Browser-based JavaScript Roguelike game using rot.js

The theme is **'Leaps and Bounds'**. Keywords are **'evolve'**, **'leap'**, **'bounds'**, **'changing or moving rapidly'**, **'2020'**.

My avatar **'evolves'** by leveling up.

Corridors and rooms may have fall traps that require you to **'jump'** over them once triggered.

**'Bounds'** are the walls.

I'll have some corridors that are covered in ice, so when you move onto them, you **'move rapidly'** until you get off the end of the ice patch, or run into an enemy or NPC.
